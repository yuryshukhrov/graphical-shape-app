## Graphical Shape Application ##

Using this application you can draw different geometry figures such as circles, rectangles, squares and dots. This program allows you to select color, shape, position and size. 

You can add new figures to existing ones, you can move figures, you can concatenate figures, you can zoom in and out, analyze figures in a separate layout window and finally print the figures. 

Graphical Shape Application allows you to save objects in XML format including their properties such as color, coordinates, size and shape. Later these objects can be recreated from this XML file. Storing objects in XML format is handy when it comes to dealing with web services and remote object manipulation.
